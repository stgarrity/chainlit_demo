      "Answer: For cleaning mud off your Cybertruck after off-roading, start by rinsing the entire exterior with water to remove loose dirt. Use a power washer for the underside, wheel wells, panel seams, and radiator. Follow with the regular cleaning process using a mild, pH-neutral soap. Don't forget to wipe mud off headlights, tail lights, and cameras to ensure all vehicle functions operate properly.\n",

Doing so can interfere with wiper friction and cause a chattering sound.\\n- CAUTION: Do not use hot water, detergents, highly alkaline or caustic cleaning ingredients or solvents, specifically those containing hydroxide.\\n- CAUTION: If using a pressure washer, maintain a distance of at least 12\" (30 cm) between the nozzle and the surface of Cybertruck. Keep the nozzle moving and do not concentrate the water jet on any one area.\\n- CAUTION: Do not aim water hoses directly at windows, door, or hood seals or at electronic modules or exposed cabling.\\n\\nCAUTION: To avoid corrosive damage that may not be covered by the warranty, rinse away any road salt from the underside of the vehicle, wheel wells, and brakes. After cleaning the vehicle, dry the brakes by going on a short drive and applying the brakes multiple times.\\n\\nCAUTION: Avoid using tight-napped or rough cloths, such as washing mitts. A high-quality microfiber cleaning cloth is recommended.\\n\\nCAUTION: If washing in an automatic car wash, use touchless car washes only. These car washes have no parts (brushes, etc.) that touch the surfaces of Cybertruck. Some touchless car washes use caustic solutions that, over time, can cause discoloration of decorative exterior trim. Avoid exposure to soaps and chemicals above pH 13. If unsure, check the product label or ask the staff at the car wash. Damage caused by improper washing is not covered by the warranty.\\n\\nCAUTION: If washing in an automatic car wash, make sure the vehicle is locked. In addition, avoid using controls on the touchscreen that can result in accidentally opening doors or trunks while the vehicle is being washed. Any damage caused is not covered by the warranty.\\n\\nCAUTION: Ensure the wipers are off before washing Cybertruck to avoid the risk of damaging the wipers.\\n\\nCAUTION: Do not use chemical based wheel cleaners or pre-wash products. These can damage the finish on the wheels.\\n\\nWARNING: Never spray liquid at a high velocity (for example, if using a pressure washer) towards the charge port while Cybertruck is charging. Failure to follow these instructions can result in serious injury or damage to the vehicle, charging equipment, or property.Car Wash\\n\\nIf taking Cybertruck to an automatic car wash is necessary, Car Wash Mode closes all windows, locks the charge port, and disables windshield wipers, Sentry Mode, and walk-away door locking. To enable, touch Controls > Car Wash. Your vehicle must be stationary and not actively charging.\\n\\nIf using an automatic car wash, Enable Free Roll keeps your vehicle in Neutral and activates free roll for the duration of the wash, while preventing Cybertruck from applying the Parking brake if you leave the driver\\'s seat. To enable, press on the brake pedal and touch Enable Free Roll; or shift into Neutral.\\n\\nCar Wash Mode disables if the vehicle\\'s speed exceeds 9 mph (15 km/h) or by touching Exit on the touchscreen.\\n\\nCAUTION: Failure to put Cybertruck in Car Wash Mode may result in damage (for example, to the charge port or windshield wipers).

      "[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Cleaning the Exterior\\n\\nTo prevent damage to the exterior, immediately remove corrosive substances (such as grease, oil, bird droppings, tree resin, dead insects, tar spots, road salt, industrial fallout, etc.). Do not wait until Cybertruck is due for a complete wash. If necessary, use denatured alcohol to remove tar spots and stubborn grease stains, then immediately wash the area with water and a mild, non-detergent soap to remove the alcohol.\\n\\n> CAUTION: Some cleaners and car shampoos contain chemicals that can cause damage or discoloration, especially for plastic trim pieces, exterior lights, or camera lenses. For example, some car cleaning formulas contain hydroxide or other highly alkaline or caustic ingredients that can damage exterior components. Do not use acidic products either. Damage or discoloration resulting from cleaning products is not covered by the warranty.\\n\\nNOTE: It is normal for the stainless steel exterior to mature over time, resulting in minor changes to the reflective properties and color of the metal.\\n\\n4. After washing, rinse with clean water to prevent soap from drying on the surfaces.\\n5. Dry thoroughly with microfiber cloths (ensure the cloths are clean of sand, dirt, rocks, etc.), one in each hand, rotating in circular motions until the surface is dry.Cautions for Exterior Cleaning\\n\\n- CAUTION: Do not wash in direct sunlight.\\n- CAUTION: Do not use windshield treatment fluids. Doing so can interfere with wiper friction and cause a chattering sound.\\n- CAUTION: Do not use hot water, detergents, highly alkaline or caustic cleaning ingredients or solvents, specifically those containing hydroxide.\\n- CAUTION: If using a pressure washer, maintain a distance of at least 12\" (30 cm) between the nozzle and the surface of Cybertruck. Keep the nozzle moving and do not concentrate the water jet on any one area.\\n- CAUTION: Do not aim water hoses directly at windows, door, or hood seals or at electronic modules or exposed cabling.\\n\\nCAUTION: To avoid corrosive damage that may not be covered by the warranty, rinse away any road salt from the underside of the vehicle, wheel wells, and brakes. After cleaning the vehicle, dry the brakes by going on a short drive and applying the brakes multiple times.\\n\\nCAUTION: Avoid using tight-napped or rough cloths, such as washing mitts. A high-quality microfiber cleaning cloth is recommended.\\n\\nCAUTION: If washing in an automatic car wash, use touchless car washes only. These car washes have no parts (brushes, etc.) that touch the surfaces of Cybertruck. Some touchless car washes use caustic solutions that, over time, can cause discoloration of decorative exterior trim. Avoid exposure to soaps and chemicals above pH 13. If unsure, check the product label or ask the staff at the car wash. Damage caused by improper washing is not covered by the warranty.\\n\\nCAUTION: If washing in an automatic car wash, make sure the vehicle is locked. In addition, avoid using controls on the touchscreen that can result in accidentally opening doors or trunks while the vehicle is being washed. Any damage caused is not covered by the warranty.\\n\\nCAUTION: Ensure the wipers are off before washing Cybertruck to avoid the risk of damaging the wipers.\\n\\nCAUTION: Do not use chemical based wheel cleaners or pre-wash products. These can damage the finish on the wheels.\\n\\nWARNING: Never spray liquid at a high velocity (for example, if using a pressure washer) towards the charge port while Cybertruck is charging. Failure to follow these instructions can result in serious injury or damage to the vehicle, charging equipment, or property.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"what's the best way to clean cybertruck exterior\"}]\n"
